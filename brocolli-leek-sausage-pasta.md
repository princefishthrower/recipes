# Broccoli, Leek, and Sausage Pasta

- 1 head brocoli
- 1 leek
- 1 spicy italian sausage, 1 normal
- olive oil
- some white wine

When noodles are 1/3 done, throw in brocoli. Meanwhile, cook the sausage in olive oil, cook it quite hot, let them stick a little add the leek and red pepper to the pan and cook a bit longer. Add some white wine and let it cook even more. Let the rigatoni and brocoli nearly finish cooking in the pot together, then add them to the pan and cover it with pecorino. Toss together and let all flavors combine.

Plate and top with more pecorino!

Such miracles from so little!
