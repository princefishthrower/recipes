# Mock Gin

This recipe will yield about 1 liter of alcohol-free "gin," which is enough for about 40 servings (assuming a serving size of 25 milliliters per cocktail). The small amount of sugar helps to balance out the bitter and savory flavors of the herbs and spices, and adds a touch of sweetness to the "gin." Enjoy!

- 1 liter water
- 40 grams juniper berries
- 40 grams coriander seeds
- 20 grams cardamom pods
- 20 grams lemon peel
- 10 grams anise seeds
- 50 grams granulated sugar

If you can get it, also add:

- 20 grams angelica root
- 10 grams licorice root

In a small saucepan, combine the water, juniper berries, coriander seeds, angelica root, cardamom pods, lemon peel, licorice root, anise seeds, and sugar. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar.

Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the mixture has reduced by about half.

Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean jar or bottle. Discard the solids.

Let the "gin" cool to room temperature. Transfer to the refrigerator to chill until ready to use.
