- Sourdough, baguette, or similar for sandwich bread
- 1 knuckle of garlic, top chopped off
- butter
- 1/2 cup of basil, handful of leaves on the side, rest chopped
- A few chili peppers
- vodka or cheap white wine (if your poor like me)
- mozzarella, sliced
- parmesan, grated

## Prepare garlic

Chop off top of garlic, wrap with foil, and cover with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Throw in oven at 400F / 200C and start roasting up to 30 minutes.

## Prepare Vodka Sauce

Chop onion and garlic and all but one of the piri piri peppers and fry. Add vodka or white wine and continue frying until golden brown. Then add san marizano tomatoes and cream. Add a pinch more of salt and reduce slightly. Then blend using a food processor or emmersion blender. Set aside.

## Cook Chicken

While the sauce is cooking and reducing, bread and fry chicken. When the chick is done, set aside.

## Prepare special butter

Finely chop all except a few leaves of basil, the knuckle of baked garlic, and a piri piri pepper and combine until uniform

## Prepare the Sandwich!

Spread the special butter on top sides of the bread. Place slices of mozarella and grated parmesan on each cooked chicken piece, return to oven until cheese is bubbling.

## Assemble the Sandwich!

Spread more vodka sauce on the lower bread, then the chicken, then a few leaves of basil, and then the top buttered bread. 

Enjoy!
