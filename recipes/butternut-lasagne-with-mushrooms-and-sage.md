Small butternut squash (2.5lbs – 3lbs) (about 4 cups, roasted)
½ a sweet onion, sliced into big wedges
olive oil for drizzling

Mushroom Filling:
2 tablespoons olive oil or butter
1 ½  lb mushrooms, sliced (cremini, button, shiitake, portobello, wild mushrooms, etc.)
1 fat shallot or ½ onion, diced
4 garlic cloves, chopped
2 tablespoons fresh chopped sage
½  teaspoon salt
optional – feel free to add a couple of handfuls baby spinach or greens and wilt them.

Ricotta Mixture:
1 lb ricotta cheese (or sub vegan tofu ricotta) If using the tofu ricotta, no need to add more salt or egg. Just nutmeg 🙂
one egg (optional)
½ teaspoon nutmeg
½ teaspoon salt

Butternut Puree:
3 tablespoons olive oil
3–6 tablespoons water
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon pepper
½ teaspoon garlic powder
1 1 /2 cups grated mozzarella cheese ( about 3–4 ounces) or sub vegan “meltable” cheese
½ cup romano or parmesan ( about 1 ounce) or sub vegan
lasagna noodles (uncooked)
Garnish with crispy sage leaves (optional, see notes)

Optional Quick Béchamel Sauce:
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil (or butter)
1 ½ tablespoons flour
1 cup milk ( or nut milk)
generous pinch salt, pepper and nutmeg
remaining ½ cup mozzarella and 2 tablespoons parmesan (or meltable vegan cheese)

Preheat oven to 425 F (218 C). Cut butternut squash in half, scoop out the seeds and place open side down on a parchment lined baking sheet. Place sliced onion next to it and drizzle it with a little olive oil. Roast until fork tender, about 30-40 minutes. Let cool. Lower oven to 375 F (190 C).

In a large skillet, heat the oil or butter. Add mushrooms and shallots and salt, and saute over medium heat, until the mushrooms release their liquid and begin to brown. Add the garlic, sage and pepper.  Cook until garlic is fragrant, about 2-3 more minutes, turn heat off. You could toss in some spinach at the end and wilt for extra nutrients. Taste and make sure the filling has enough salt and pepper.

Using a fork, mix the ricotta cheese with the egg, nutmeg and salt.

When the butternut is cool enough to handle, scoop all the flesh out into a food processor. You should have about 4 cups. Add the roasted onion, olive oil, water, salt, pepper and garlic powder. Puree until smooth. You will need at least 3 1/2  cups pureed and you want it to be almost saucy, like a marinara sauce. Add water as needed.

In a greased 9 x13 inch baking dish, add 1 cup of the butternut puree and spread out into a thin layer. Top with 3 lasagna noodles. Add ½ of the ricotta mixture and spread out evenly. Top with half of the cooked mushrooms and onion mixture. Sprinkle with ½ cup grated mozzarella and a couple tablespoons romano cheese. Add 3 more lasagna noodles. Spread out the rest of the ricotta mixture as evenly as possible. Spoon half of the remaining butternut puree, erring on the side of less than half, so you have enough to cover the top (save at least 1 ¼ cups for the top.) Add the remaining mushrooms onion mixture and sprinkle with another ½ cup shredded mozzarella and couple tablespoons parmesan. Place the final three noodles over the top. Lather with the remaining butternut puree and sprinkle with the rest of the cheese (or make the creamy béchamel sauce)

Cover tightly with foil and bake in 375 F oven for 40 minutes. (If the foil touches the lasagana, place a layer of parchment beween the foil and lasagna). Uncover and continue baking 15-20 minutes until golden and bubbly. Cut into 9 servings.  Garnish with optional crispy sage leaves.
