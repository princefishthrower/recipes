# Pad Gaprao

This popular Thai dish has many English spellings: Pad Kra Pao, Pad Ka Prao, Pad Ka Pow, Pad Krapow…etc. “Pad gaprao” is the phonetically closest spelling, but it seems to be the least popular way because most Thai people mispronounce it to begin with! Doesn’t matter, because no matter how you spell it, they all point to this same delicious, rustic, spicy stir-fry featuring the aroma of holy basil. For a truly classic way to serve this dish, pour it over rice and top with a fried egg!

5–10 Thai chilies, or to taste
5 cloves garlic
1 spur chilies or another mild, red pepper, chopped (when using less chilis, 2-3 peppers is also fine)
½ cup long beans, cut into short pieces
½ small onion, diced
300g chicken OR pork OR beef OR soy, coarsely ground
1 Tbsp oyster sauce
1 Tbsp soy sauce
2 tsp fish sauce
1½ tsp black soy sauce (or sub dark soy sauce and reduce regular soy sauce to 2 tsp)
2 Tbsp water
1 ½ tsp sugar
1 ½  cup holy basil leaves, loosely packed (italian basil is fine as a substitute)
Vegetable oil, as needed 
2–3 eggs (1 per person, if frying egg variant)
Prik Nam Pla (condiment for seasoning the egg, optional): Mix together some fish sauce, a squeeze of lime juice, chopped Thai chilies, and chopped garlic.
Jasmine rice for serving

Pound chilies into a fine paste.
Add garlic and spur chilies and pound into a rough paste.
Combine oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, black soy sauce, water and sugar; stir to dissolve the sugar.
In a wok or a large saute pan, saute the garlic-chili paste in a little vegetable oil over medium high heat until the garlic starts to turn golden.
Add meat and toss until it's no longer in big clumps.
Add onions and long beans; toss until the meat is done.
Remove from heat and stir in the holy basil.
Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.

If frying egg:
Heat about 1 cm of vegetable oil in a small non-stick pan or a wok over medium high heat.
Once the oil is hot (you want the oil very hot, especially if you like runny yolk), crack the egg directly into the pan and let it fry until the edges are browned and bubbly.
