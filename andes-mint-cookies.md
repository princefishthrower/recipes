# Andes Mint Cookies

- 1/2 cup (113 g) unsalted butter, room - temperature
- 1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup (100 g) dark brown sugar, packed
- 1 large egg, preferably room temperature
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup + 2 Tbsp. Cocoa Powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 Tbsp. milk or heavy whipping cream
- 1 cup chopped Andes Mints plus a little more for topping
- 1/3 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips (or Mint Chips for more mint flavor)

Preheat the oven to 350Ëš F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the butter and sugars. Beat together on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 2-3 minutes. Blend in the egg and vanilla, scrape down the bowl if needed.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Slowly add the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients in the mixer on low speed just until incorporated. Mix in the milk on the lowest speed and fold in the Andes Mints and chocolate chips.

Roll about 2 tablespoons of dough into balls and place on the baking sheets. Top each cookie with a few more Andes Mints.

Bake 10-11 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheets for about 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
