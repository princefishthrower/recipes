# Grandma Irene's Meatballs

1.5 lbs ground chuck
1.5 links Sweet Italian Sausage
2.5 28oz cans Hunts Tomato Sauce
1/2 Loaf White Sandwich Bread; crusts removed
2 extra large eggs
Whole milk to dampen bread
Vegetable oil for browning
Italian spices & garlic powder to taste for sauce

Put ground chuck in large mixing bowl. Add eggs. Mix lightly with your hands. Put a small amount of milk in a shallow dish (like a pie pan).  Lightly dampen de-crusted bread with milk (not too much) and add to chuck and eggs, tearing into chunks and mixing as you go with your hands.  Do not over mix; you don't want them to be too mushy.  Visible chunks of bread is good and you may have to adjust the amount of bread to more or less depending on the mush factor. :) Shape meat mixture into meatballs.

Heat oil in skillet and brown sausage links first and then add to sauce. Brown meatballs a few at a time so you can turn them easily to brown all sides. Be very gentle so they don't break apart. You may need to loosen them with a spatula to turn. 

Add tomato sauce and spices to pot. Simmer for at several hours (all day is better!) until cooked through, occasionally stirring very gently, and adding spices to the sauce to taste.
