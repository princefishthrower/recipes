# Pasta Cacio e Pepe

## Ingredients
- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tbsp black peppercorns
- 500g spaghetti

Use a mortar and pestle to crush the peppercorns. Toast the peppercorns in a pan on medium heat for 20 seconds. Then add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and toss in some tap water. Cook the pasta leaving the last 3 minutes to cook in the pan with the peppercorns. Switch off the heat and wait 30 seconds. Add a healthy helping of pecorino, and then the cooking water. Add cooking water as needed to keep creamy. Optionally serve with more pecorino.
